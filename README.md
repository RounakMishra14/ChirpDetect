## About the Project

**ChirpDetect** is a cool project that uses machine learning to help identify bird species from audio recordings. The main idea is to take bird sounds, process them, and classify them into specific bird species. This project is designed for birdwatchers, researchers, and even casual nature enthusiasts who want to know what birds are singing around them. It combines several key features:

- **Audio Augmentation**: We didnâ€™t just rely on the original bird recordings. By using methods like pitch shifting, time stretching, and adding noise, we made the dataset more diverse and robust for training.
  
- **Spectrogram Preprocessing**: Instead of working directly with raw audio, we convert it into spectrograms (visual representations of sound frequencies over time). These act as images for our CNN model to analyze.

- **CNN Model for Classification**: We built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify bird sounds. The model learns from the spectrograms and predicts which bird species is calling. 

- **Streamlit Web App**: The project includes a simple web app built with Streamlit, where users can upload their own audio recordings. The app then processes the audio and gives back the predicted bird species.

- **Data Visualization**: To make results easy to interpret, the app shows the classification results in tables and pie charts (using Plotly), so you can see the density and types of birds in the audio clip at a glance.
