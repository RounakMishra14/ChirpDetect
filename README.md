# ChirpDetect

**ChirpDetect** is an innovative web application designed to classify bird sounds from audio clips using deep learning techniques. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and user-friendly interfaces, this project aims to provide enthusiasts and researchers with an efficient tool for identifying various bird species based on their calls.

## About the Project

The **ChirpDetect** project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze and classify audio recordings of bird sounds. The application processes audio input, extracts features, and provides real-time classification results, allowing users to identify bird species in their surroundings easily.

- **Multi-Class Support:** Identifies multiple bird species and noise classification.
- **Visualization:** Displays results in an interactive format with pie charts and data tables.
- **Audio Upload:** Users can upload audio files for analysis.

## Installation

To set up the **ChirpDetect** project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChirpDetect.git
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory

Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd ChirpDetect
```

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS/Linux:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 4: Install Required Packages

Install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Run the Application

Finally, run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Your default web browser should open with the **ChirpDetect** application running.

## Usage

Once the application is running, users can upload audio files or use live recording to classify bird sounds. The results will be displayed in an organized format, showcasing the detected bird species and their counts.
