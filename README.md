## About the Project

**Bird Sound Classifier** is a machine learning-based application designed to identify bird species from their audio recordings. By leveraging audio processing techniques and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the project classifies bird calls into various species commonly found in the dataset. The project includes the following features:

- **Audio Augmentation**: Augments bird sound data with techniques like pitch shifting, time stretching, and adding noise to generate a robust dataset for training.
- **Spectrogram Preprocessing**: Converts raw audio files into spectrograms, which are used as input for the CNN model.
- **CNN Model for Classification**: Utilizes a deep learning model trained to detect and classify bird species based on their unique audio signatures.
- **Streamlit Web App**: A user-friendly interface allowing users to upload their own bird sound recordings for classification and visualization of detected species.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays the classification results through tables and pie charts using Plotly for easy interpretation.

This project aims to facilitate bird species identification, contributing to birdwatching, conservation efforts, and bioacoustic research.
