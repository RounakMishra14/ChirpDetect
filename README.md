# ChirpDetect üê¶

## üìò Overview
**ChirpDetect** is an interactive bird sound classification app built with Streamlit and powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to help users identify bird species from their calls. The app allows users to either upload or record audio clips, and then classifies the bird sounds in real time. By leveraging TensorFlow for the machine learning model, Librosa for audio processing, and Plotly for visualization, the app provides a seamless and informative user experience.

The project is built using locally recorded bird call samples from the surrounding area [located here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/45fe6eRNAD3a4nrz6). Due to the limited number of available recordings, **data augmentation** techniques were applied to enhance the dataset. Methods such as time-stretching, pitch-shifting, and adding background noise helped simulate various real-world scenarios. This allowed the model to generalize better and perform effectively, even with the small dataset, by creating a more diverse and robust set of training samples.
